# TN Scheme Navigator AI  
## Tamil Nadu Government Scheme Assistant with Hybrid Graph RAG

TN Scheme Navigator AI is a Streamlit-based AI application that helps users search, understand, and verify Tamil Nadu Government scheme information.

The project combines:

- ChromaDB Vector RAG for semantic search
- NetworkX local graph fallback for relationship-based scheme discovery
- Optional Neo4j AuraDB Graph RAG for advanced knowledge graph querying
- OpenAI for final answer generation
- Tamil, English, and Bilingual response support

The app is designed for a citizen-friendly Tamil Nadu scheme discovery experience.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Government scheme information is often available online, but citizens may find it difficult to search, understand, and compare.

This project solves that by allowing users to ask simple questions such as:

```text
Which schemes are available for farmers?
```

```text
Which schemes are sponsored by State?
```

```text
விவசாயிகளுக்கான மானிய திட்டங்கள் எவை?
```

The app retrieves relevant scheme information and explains it in a simple format with official source references.

## One Working Example Query

Run the app and ask this question in the **Knowledge Graph RAG** page:

```text
Which schemes are sponsored by State?
```

Expected style of output:

```text
Relevant schemes found:

1. [Scheme Name]
   Department: Agriculture - Farmers Welfare Department
   Beneficiary: Farmers
   Benefit Type: Grants / Subsidy / Training
   Sponsored By: State
   Source: Official Tamil Nadu Government source link

Note: Verify final eligibility and application process from the official source link.
```

Tamil example:

```text
விவசாயிகளுக்கான மானிய திட்டங்கள் எவை?
```

```

Current focus department:

```text
Agriculture - Farmers Welfare Department
```

## Active AI Engine Flow

The Streamlit app uses this active engine flow:

```text
app.py
  ↓
run_hybrid_ai()
  ↓
hybrid_rag_engine.ask_hybrid_ai()
  ↓
├── rag_engine.ask_scheme_ai()
│     └── ChromaDB Vector RAG
│
└── graph_rag_engine.ask_graph_ai()
      ├── NetworkX local graph fallback
      └── Optional Neo4j AuraDB Graph RAG when USE_NEO4J=true
```

By default, the app runs with:

```text
ChromaDB Vector RAG + NetworkX Graph Fallback
```

Neo4j AuraDB is optional.

This makes the project easier to run locally without requiring live cloud graph infrastructure.

---

## Local Run Mode Without Neo4j

The project can run locally without Neo4j AuraDB.

In this mode:

- Vector RAG uses ChromaDB
- Graph-style relationship lookup uses NetworkX
- No live Neo4j database is required

Set this in `.env`:

```env
USE_NEO4J=false
```

Or leave `USE_NEO4J` unset. The app will use NetworkX fallback by default.

---

## Optional Neo4j Mode

To enable Neo4j AuraDB Graph RAG, add the following to `.env`:

```env
USE_NEO4J=true
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-aura-uri.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password_here
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

Then run:

```cmd
python load_graph_to_neo4j.py
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

` scrape_schemes.py ` scrapes scheme information from the Tamil Nadu Government website.

Output:

```text
data/tn_scheme_details.csv
```

---

### 2. Vector RAG

` ingest.py ` converts scheme records into LangChain documents and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.

Used for meaning-based questions.

Example:

```text
What schemes are available for farmers?
```

---

### 3. NetworkX Graph Fallback

` graph_rag_engine.py ` builds a local NetworkX graph from the CSV file.

It creates graph-style relationships such as:

```text
Scheme → Department
Scheme → Beneficiary
Scheme → Benefit Type
Scheme → Sponsor
```

This allows the app to answer relationship-style questions even without Neo4j.

Example:

```text
Which schemes are sponsored by State?
```

---

### 4. Optional Neo4j Graph RAG

When `USE_NEO4J=true`, the app uses Neo4j AuraDB and Cypher-based Graph RAG.

This is useful for advanced graph querying and visual database exploration.

---

### 5. Hybrid RAG

` hybrid_rag_engine.py ` combines:

```text
Vector RAG answer
+
Graph RAG answer
+
OpenAI final response
```

The final response is generated in English, Tamil, or Bilingual format.

---

## Prompt Quality

The app uses explicit prompt instructions for language control and answer quality.

### Tamil Response Instruction

```text
Respond fully in Tamil.
Use simple, clear Tamil that a normal citizen can understand.
Keep government scheme names in English if exact translation may confuse the user.
Explain eligibility, benefit, how to apply, and source clearly.
```

### English Response Instruction

```text
Respond in clear professional English.
Keep the answer simple, structured, and citizen-friendly.
```

### Bilingual Response Instruction

```text
Respond in both English and Tamil.
First give a short English answer.
Then provide the Tamil explanation below it.
Keep the Tamil simple and citizen-friendly.
```

### Final Hybrid RAG Prompt Structure

```text
You are TN Scheme Navigator AI, an expert assistant for Tamil Nadu Government schemes.

Inputs:
- User question
- Selected response language
- Language instruction
- Routing decision
- Vector RAG answer
- Graph RAG answer
- Official source references

Rules:
1. Use only retrieved Vector RAG and Graph RAG information.
2. Do not invent scheme details.
3. If information is not available, say so clearly.
4. Mention scheme names clearly.
5. Explain beneficiaries, benefits, sponsor or department, and how to apply if available.
6. Keep the answer simple and citizen-friendly.
7. Ask the user to verify details from official source links.
```
